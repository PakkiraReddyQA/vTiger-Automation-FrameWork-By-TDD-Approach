Generic Utilities:
1. What is Generic Utility? How is it related with framework?
  Ans:
Generic utility is common for all our testScript
it holds under src/main/java
generic utility will be consists of generic classes and generic method
whatever we provide methods will not be executed until we will call it in our testScript
Generic utilitys used for mainly Code Reausability,
This class contains all generic methods ,Automation Rule says that never hard code any data 
everything will be generic method we will provide aruguments and then only it will execute 
Example:Baseclass,propertyfile,excelfileUtility,listeners,WebDriverUtility
If we didnot hard code method that will be generic method
return type generic method will void if doesnot return any value
return type generic method will be decided if its return any value



2. Write any 2 methods From Excel Utility
Ans:
public void readDatafromExcel(String sheet,int rowNo,int cellNo)
{

FileInputStream fis=new FileInputStream("path of excel file");
WorkBook Book=WorkBookFactory.create(fis);
Sheet sh=Book.getSheet(sheet);
String value=sh.createRow(rowNo).createCell(cellNo).getStringCellValue();
return value;

}
public void readDatafromExcel(String sheet,int rowNo,int cellNO)
{

FileInputStream fis=new FileInputStream("path of excel file");
WorkBook Book=WorkBookFactory.create(fis);
Sheet sh=Book.createSheet(sheet);
String ce=sh.createRow(rowNo).createCell(cellNo);
   ce.setcellvalue(cellNo);
FileOutputputStream fos=new FileOutputStream("path of excel file");
wb.write(fos);
return value;

}



3. write An 2 re-usable Methods to Handle drop down
Ans:
public void handleDrodown(WebElement element,int index)
{
Select sc=new Select(element);
sc.selectByindex(index);
}
public void handleDrodown(WebElement element,String visibleText)
{
Select sc=new Select(element);
sc.selectByvisibleText(visibleText);
}



4. write any 3 generic method to Handle Synchronization in your framework
Ans:

public void waitforpageload(webDriver driver)
{
driver.manage().timeouts().impliciltyWait(Duration.ofSeconds);
}



public void waitelementclickble(webDriver driver,webElement element)
{
webDriverWait wt=new webDriverWait(driver,Duration.ofSeconds(10));
wt.until(ExpectedCondition.elementTobeclickble(element));
}


public void waitelementclickble(webDriver driver,webElement element)
{
webDriverWait wt=new webDriverWait(driver,Duration.ofSeconds(20));
wt.until(ExpectedConditions.elementTobevisble(element));
}




5. write  any 3 generic methods from Web driver Utility
Ans:
public void maximize(webDriver driver)
{
driver.manage().window().maximize();
}


public void doubleClick(webDriver driver)
{
Actions act=new Actions(driver);
act.doubleClick().perform();
}

public void rightClick(webDriver driver)
{
Actions act=new Actions(driver);
act.contextClick().perform();
}

public void rightClick(webDriver driver,webElement element)
{
Actions act=new Actions(driver);
act.contextClick(element).perform();
}


6. Explain the advantages of using generic utilty component
Ans:
Code reausability,no need do the same actions again and again 
we can save time while deloping script ,so its one time investment
No need to remember webActions
we can easily call the classes in scripts 


7. What are the classes and interfaces in generic utility.

Ans:
WebDriverUtility-class
BaseClass-class
ListenerImplemetationclass-class
IRetryAnalyserClass-class
ExcelfileUtility-class
propertyfileUtility-class
IconstantUtality-interface
javaUtality-class






Object Repository
1. What is Object Repository? Why Object Repo?
Ans:
Object repository is well structred design by google,Automation rule says never hardcode the Elements in the Script
here we can store all the webElements with help of Locators and no need to find again aga
if UI changes also once if we make changes in Object repository it will easy for modification,so it will not distrub our testScript  


2. Why POM classes are prefered for Object repository?
Ans:
Object repository is well strctred and google mostly prefeerred to develop pom classes
we will find Elements with help of @FindBy,@FindAll,@FindBys 
not with driver once after finding we will intializing the driver to the elements 
Every time if page refreshed also Updated driver get intialized to so NosuchElememntRefecw we will not get


3. What is POM and write all the rules of POM?
Ans:
POM Is page Object model its is well designed structred and preffred to use pom by google
Create classs name with title of the webPage and ending with Page
find the all the elements through  @FindBy,@FindAll,@FindBys 
for every element make it with private accesModifier ,so we can access that particular classs itself
create Constructor intialize driver with help of pagefactor and initselements() method
we will not alter the elements so we cant do setters
finally utiliztion override all the getter methods
then we can use business library's as its convinet


4. Difference between POM and PageFactory
Ans:
Pom is well structred design and we will use pom for storing webElemnts with help of @FindBy,@FindAll,@FindBys 
PageFactory is used to intialize webDriver with help of initelemnts() so webElements will gets intialized with updated webDriver

5. Difference between @findBy and driver.findElements()
Ans:
@findBy is used identify webElemnts present in the webpage initally driver is not required later its gets intilized with help updated driver,
so if page got refreshed also it will still identify the webelemnts

driver.findElements() is used identify webElemnts present in the webpage it will required driver intially ,
so if page got refreshed  it will not identify  the webelemnts,elements got Stale it will not identify those elements



6. Explain @FindBy, @FindAll, @FindBys
Ans:
@FindBy, @FindAll, @FindBys
 is used identify webElemnts present in the webpage initally driver is not required later its gets intilized with help updated driver,
so if page got refreshed also it will still identify the webelemnts
@FindBy
with help this we can find with help of one locator finds one WebElement for same element
 @FindAll
we can find more than webelement for same element more than one locator also 
it will work like both elements correct then it will find other wise it will not identified
@FindBys
we can find more than webelement for same element more than one locator also 
it will work like if anyone  element is  correct then it will identify it work like OR Oprator


7. Develop POM Class for a login Page
Ans:
public class loginPage
{
//Declaration
@FindBy(name="user_name")
private WebElmenet userNameEdt;
@FindBy(name="user_password")
private WebElmenet passwordEdt;
@FindBy(id="submitButton");
private WebElement LoginButton;

//intialization
public loginPage(WebDriver driver)
{
PageFactory.initElements(driver,this);
}

//Utilization
public WebElement getusername()
{
return userNameEdt;
}
public WebElement getusername()
{
return passwordEdt;
}
public WebElement getusername()
{
return LoginButton; 
}
//Businees Libraries
public void loginApp(String username,String password )
{
userNameEdt.sendkeys(username);
passwordEdt.sendkeys(password);
LoginButton.click();
}

}


8. What is StaleElementReference Exception? How POM will handle it
Ans:
if webPage is got refreshed or if internet issue is at that time driver is unable to find webElement so we will get StaleElementReference 
POM will handle  StaleElementReference Exception here we will find webelements with help of @FindBy, @FindAll, @FindBys
So if page is also got refreshed the updated driver will gets intialized and it will identifyed  the webelements so will not get StaleElementReference Exception 


9. What is Auto healing?
Ans:
with help of @FindAll if we identify webElements if any one not idetifying also one is working fine also it will find webElements this proces is called AutoHealing
Automatically it will move from one element to other element it will work like as OR OPrator



Scenario based
1. Agile process demands frequent UI changes, How do u handle this situation
Ans:

Agile process demands frequent UI changes, we will implemnets POM Classes in our Framework so if frequently UI Changes also our TestScript will never distrub,
if we make changes  WebElements in the POM Classes our testScript will remaing same ,maintance aND MODIfication going to easy 

2. Session Id for a page keeps on Changing when ever the page is refreshed, How do hanlde
   This situation
Ans:
if webPage is got refreshed or if internet issue is at that time driver is unable to find webElement so we will get StaleElementReference 
POM will handle  StaleElementReference Exception here we will find webelements with help of @FindBy, @FindAll, @FindBys
So if page is also got refreshed the updated driver will gets intialized and it will identifyed  the webelements so will not get StaleElementReference Exception 



3. One of web pages consists of 5 drop downs, How do handle it
Ans:
we will create pom class for that webPage and we will identify all the eleemnts and seleect actions and we will call it in our testScript


4. How do u handle synchronization in Selenium.
Ans:
IMpliciltywait
ExplicitlyWait
FluentWait

5. What are the total number of pom classes present in your framework.
Ans:
No of WebPages = no of Pom classes
EXample:for application 15 web pages are present
webpages 15=pom classes also 15


Questions - MAVEN:
1. What is Maven explain Advantages? 
Ans:
Here Pom.xml file is present simply we can add the Dependncys if Version also want update no need to remove just if we change version no
we can build our frame works eaisly
we will get inbuild Reports 
NO need to download jars again and again
We can execute our test script outside of the Eclipse


2. Explain Maven Folder Structure
Ans:
src/main/java-we can store generic utilits and objectReposiotorys
src/mainResources-
src/test/java-we can build our test scripts as our convenient 
src/testResources-we can store our extrnalfiles like properyfile,excel sheet files
src/testOutputs-we wil have pomxml file and reports
src/extentReports-extent reports



3. Explain the dependencies feature in Maven
Ans:
dependencie is advance feature in maven with help of dependencie it will download automatically jars form globalRepository

4. Explain Build life Cycle
Ans:
once after devopers developed the source code they will compress and compile the source code make the build 
after it will install in testing server for testing ,for multiple test cycle testing going to happan if build is stable it will install uat serveer there 
it will check all the scenarios and finally installed in production server

5. What are the different maven commands
Ans:
mvn clear
mvn validate
mvn compile
mvn test
mvn -Dtest=classname test
mvn -Dtest=class1Nmae,class2Name test
mvn -Dtest=className#methodName test
mvn -P profileId
mvn -Pusername=username test

6. What happends if we execute mvn test

Ans:if we execute mvn test it will execute only the testScripts whose name ended with test

7. Write maven command to provide username and password through cmd line
Ans:mvn -Dusername=admin -Dpassword=manager -Durl=testen.com test


8. Write maven command to execute only one test class through cmd Line
Ans:mvn -Dtest=classname test

9. Write maven command to execute only one test method inside a test class through cmd Line
Ans:mvn -Dtest=className#methodName test

10. How do you execute suite xml file through cmd line?
Ans:mvn -P profileId
we will create .xml file for particular class and that suite file we will going give in pom.xml file then we have create profile ,there we will give id 
that name will through command (mvn -P profileId)

11. I have 5 different suite xml files for 5 different execution, i want to decide which 
    suite file to be executed during runtime, what is your approach.
Ans:
i will create profiles for 5 .xml files sepearatly ,in profile i given id ,with help of this i will going to use command at runtime (mvn -P profileId)

12. how do you read data from cmd Line?
Ans:
i will create .xml file for class and i will create profile for that .xml file and i will give command in command line  
13. What are Maven parameters?
Ans:
to pass any data through command line when get situation we can pass the values 
14. What is Maven Profiling?
Ans:
its plugin in pom.xml with help of this we can execute suite xmlfiles at run time though command line also we can execute

Questions - GIT:
1. Why github?
Ans:
to store frameworks of  automationengineers
to store Source use of developers
to store manual testcases and CRS doucments 
it is Global repository there we can push our code and we can import at any time and if team want work github is main thing

2. What are different git commands
Ans:
commit
push
pull
import
clone
git
merge
fork
rebash
3. What is branching in github
Ans:
without pushing directly from local repo to master repo we will push our code into Branching and there it will merge who has autorites 
if we use branching we never get confilcts becoz for one repo one owner present, we can just push the code to branch nopt repo so we will not get confilcts

4.What is difference between git and github?
Ans:
git is locally created local file from working directory
But gibHUb is Global repo if we commit and push it will copy from working directory to giTHub
  
5. What is pull request?
Ans:
After creating branch need to give intimation for  owner of the GitHub we will creating pull request in github   

6. What is difference between merge and rebase?
Ans:
merge will help to  merge individual branch 
rebase will help to merge no of branches we can merge at a time

7. can v pull without import?
Ans:no we cant pull 
8. can v push without commit?
Ans:No we cant push without commit
